GCC for OS/2
============

This repository contains the GCC source code with the patches needed to build it
on the eComStation (OS/2) operating system. One day all patches will be merged
upstream but currently it is more convenient for the developers to track them
separately.

Build instructions
------------------

These instructions assume you have the RPM/YUM environment installed.
See http://svn.netlabs.org/rpm for details.

1. Install the necessary packages from RPM with:

        yum install os2-base-fhs ash gcc gcc-wlink gcc-wrc grep gmp-devel mpfr-devel gettext-devel diffutils gawk flex sed

2. Make a build directory outside the source tree.

3. Change to that directory and run configure & make using the following
   SH script (tailor it to your needs, check also step 4 below):

        export LANG=C

        export SHELL=sh
        export CONFIG_SHELL=$SHELL
        export MAKESHELL=$SHELL

        export PATH=`echo $PATH | sed -e 's@\\\\@/@g'`
        export ac_executable_extensions='.exe'

        export CFLAGS='-O2 -march=pentium -mtune=pentium4'
        export CXXFLAGS='-O2 -march=pentium -mtune=pentium4'
        export LDFLAGS='-Zomf -Zmap -Zargs-wild -Zhigh-mem -s'

        # Make sure xgcc will find its own cc1/cc1plus instead of the host ones
        export PATH="<PATH_TO_BUILD>/gcc${PATH:+;$PATH}"

        # Make sure programs linked with xgcc will find the correct gccXXX.dll
        export BEGINLIBPATH="<PATH_TO_BUILD>/gcc${BEGINLIBPATH:+;$BEGINLIBPATH}"

        <PATH_TO_SRC>/configure \
            --with-sysroot=/@unixroot \
            --prefix=<PATH_TO_BUILD>/install \
            --enable-shared \
            --enable-languages=c,c++ \
            --with-gnu-as \
            --disable-bootstrap \
            --disable-multilib \
            --disable-libstdcxx-pch \
            --enable-threads

        make SYSTEM_HEADER_DIR=$UNIXROOT/usr/include

        make install

4. Autoconf is hell.
